## Puzzle OS

Protected mode multitasking operating system for IA-32 processors.

### How to run?

Use `puzzleOS.iso` to boot as VM or from CD. The kernel is multiboot compatible, so grub should recognize it.

### How to build?

There are some make files and Xcode projects, but no instructions will be provided at this time.

### Any docs?

No. This code is absolutely self-documented (especially it's asm part =)

If you're interested – create an issue – I'll provide some description here.

### License?

Yes. MIT. Be free to use it and ask me any question.
